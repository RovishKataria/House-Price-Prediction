# House Price Prediction

This project implements machine learning models to predict house prices using various features and algorithms. The implementation includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Models Implemented

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
4. Random Forest Regression
5. XGBoost Regression

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation
- Model performance comparison
- Feature importance analysis

## Results

The models were evaluated using various metrics including:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (RÂ²) score

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `last_submission.ipynb`
2. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
3. Run the cells in sequence to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Train the models
   - Evaluate and compare results
